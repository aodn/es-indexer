Moving at an average forward velocity of 25 - 40 cm/s the glider travels in a sawtooth pattern through the water navigating its way to a series of pre-programmed waypoints using GPS and altimeter measurements.  Operating on C cell alkaline batteries, typical deployments can range up to 500 km with a duration of approximately 30 days.",
