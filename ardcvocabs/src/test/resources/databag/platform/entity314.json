The buoy is configured as a sensor-float with a Campbell Scientific logger, spread-spectrum radio and 2.4/5 GHz 802.11 wireless for communicating with the base station (located at the workshop near the Research Station) a surface mounted (60cm under the water surface) thermistor and an inductive modem to support a range of inductive sensors, initially this will be a SeaBird SBE39 measuring temperature and pressure (depth) and a SeaBird SBE37 measuring conductivity (salinity), temperature and pressure (depth). As of August 2010 the inductive sensors are located along a 50m cable that runs north into the main lagoon with a SBE39 located at the base of the buoy and the 37 at the end of the sensor run. This float was decommissioned in April 2022.", "inScheme" : {"_about" : "http://vocab.aodn.org.au/def/platform/1", "hasConcept" : "http://vocab.aodn.org.au/def/platform/entity/314"}
