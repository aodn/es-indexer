The base station collects data from the outlying sensor stations (RP1-RP3) within the lagoon of One Tree Island as well as having a LiCor 192 PAR sensor. The base station consists of a Campbell Scientific CR1000 logger that talks back to the mainland via a 5m mast located on the top of the tower and a Cybertec nextG modem, and to the rest of the equipment in the lagoon via a 900 MHz spread-spectrum Campbell RF411 radio. The station is powered off the research station power supply but has its own solar panel and battery supply in case of power outages.", "inScheme" : {"_about" : "http://vocab.aodn.org.au/def/platform/1", "hasConcept" : "http://vocab.aodn.org.au/def/platform/entity/330"}
