The pole provides network connectivity for the other Relay Poles located on the northen edge of Orpheus Island (RP2 and RP3) as well as a back-haul link to the mainland using a nextG connection. The pole has an array of sensors on it including two MEA thermistors located 50m and 100m away from the pole on a transect from the pole into the deep water of the channel. The pole also has a SeaBird SBE39 (temp + pressure) located around 100m from teh pole and a SBE37 (conductivity, temperature and pressure) located approximatly 200m from teh pole in the deep waters of the channels. The pole was decommissioned in July 2018.", "inScheme" : {"_about" : "http://vocab.aodn.org.au/def/platform/1", "hasConcept" : "http://vocab.aodn.org.au/def/platform/entity/316"}
