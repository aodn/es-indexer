In December 2011, a replacement buoy was deployed with the above water sensors being the existing AIMS weather station units and the in-water sensors being provided under the IMOS funded GBROOS project. This resulted in a data gap between the cyclone in February 2011 and the buoy being deployed in December 2011. It is antcipated that the AIMS weather station will be restored in late 2012 in which case the above water sensors will transition back to the AIMS tower with the in-water sensors remaining as part of the IMOS funded work. This buoy was decommissioned in 2015.", "inScheme" : {"_about" : "http://vocab.aodn.org.au/def/platform/1", "hasConcept" : "http://vocab.aodn.org.au/def/platform/entity/323"}
