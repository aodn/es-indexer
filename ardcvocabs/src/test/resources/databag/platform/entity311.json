The buoy is configured as a sensor-float with a Campbell Scientific logger, spread-spectrum radio and 2.4/5 GHz 802.11 wireless for communicating with the base station (located at the workshop near the Research Station) a surface mounted (60cm under the water surface) thermistor and an inductive modem to support a range of inductive sensors, initially this will be a SeaBird SBE39 measuring temperature and pressure (depth) and a SeaBird SBE37 measuring conductivity (salinity), temperature and depth. As of August 2010 the inductive sensors are just located in the area around the buoy, it is intended at a later date to re-position these southwards on the external reef slope to give a profile of water outside the lagoon. This buoy was decommissioned in March 2018.", "inScheme" : {"_about" : "http://vocab.aodn.org.au/def/platform/1", "hasConcept" : "http://vocab.aodn.org.au/def/platform/entity/311"}
