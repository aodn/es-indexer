This is used for the calibration of the TOPEX/Poseidon (T/P) and Jason-1 satellite altimeters. This location lies on the descending (N -> S) pass 088 of the satellite altimeter, and thus shares similar satellite orbit characteristics to the Bass Strait mooring. The use of these two sites allows detailed investigation into the accuracy of the altimeter over two different wave climates. The average significant wave height at Storm Bay is approximately double that observed at the comparatively sheltered Bass Strait location. This mooring is operated by CSIRO. This mooring was decommissioned in September 2016.", "inScheme" : {"_about" : "http://vocab.aodn.org.au/def/platform/1", "hasConcept" : "http://vocab.aodn.org.au/def/platform/entity/561"}
