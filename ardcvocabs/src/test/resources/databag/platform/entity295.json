Manufactured by iROBOT, they are designed to operate in the open ocean in depth up to 1000m.  Moving at an average forward velocity of 25 cm/s, Seagliders travel more slowly, alternately diving and climbing along slanting glide paths.  The gliders obtain GPS navigation fixes when they surface, which they use to glide through a sequence of programmed targets.  As they are deployed in the open ocean, Seagliders have a very large range sufficient to transit entire ocean basins and can be deployed for periods of up to 6 months.", "inScheme" : {"_about" : "http://vocab.aodn.org.au/def/platform/1", "hasConcept" : "http://vocab.aodn.org.au/def/platform/entity/295"}
