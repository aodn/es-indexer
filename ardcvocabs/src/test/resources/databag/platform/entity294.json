Manufactured by the Seaglider Fabrication Center at the University of Washington, the gliders are designed to operate in the open ocean in depth up to 1000m.  Moving at an average forward velocity of 25 cm/s, Seagliders travel more slowly, alternately diving and climbing along slanting glide paths.  The gliders obtain GPS navigation fixes when they surface, which they use to glide through a sequence of programmed targets.  As they are deployed in the open ocean, Seagliders have a very large range sufficient to transit entire ocean basins and can be deployed for periods of up to 6 months.", "inScheme" : {"_about" : "http://vocab.aodn.org.au/def/platform/1", "hasConcept" : "http://vocab.aodn.org.au/def/platform/entity/294"}
