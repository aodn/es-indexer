Made up of 53 Member States and 9 Associate Members, with a geographical scope that stretches from Turkey in the west to the Pacific island nation of Kiribati in the east, and from the Russian Federation in the north to New Zealand in the south, the region is home to 4.1 billion people, or two thirds of the world\u2019s population. This makes ESCAP the most comprehensive of the United Nations five regional commissions, and the largest United Nations body serving the Asia-Pacific region with over 600 staff. Established in 1947 with its headquarters in Bangkok, Thailand, ESCAP works to overcome some of the region\u2019s greatest challenges by providing results oriented projects, technical assistance and capacity building to member States.", "exactMatch" : ["http://seadatanet.maris2.nl/v_edmo/print.asp?n_code=4355"], "hiddenLabel" : [{"_value" : "ESCAP", "_lang" : "en"}
