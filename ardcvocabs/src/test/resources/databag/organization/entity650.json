Current PMEL programs focus on open ocean observations in support of long-term monitoring and prediction of the ocean environment on time scales from hours to decades. Studies are conducted to improve our understanding of the world\u2019s oceans, to define processes driving the global climate system, and to improve environmental forecasting capabilities for public safety, marine commerce, and fisheries. Results from PMEL research activities contribute to NOAA\u2019s mission goals: 1. Protect, restore, and manage the use of coastal and ocean resources through ecosystem-based management, 2. Understand climate variability and change to enhance society\u2019s ability to plan and respond, 3. Serve society\u2019s needs for weather and water information, and 4. Support the Nation\u2019s commerce with information for safe, efficient, and environmentally sound transportation. PMEL has the capability to collect oceanographic data from any depth at any location in the world\u2019s oceans and distribute these data in real-time over the internet.", "displayLabel" : "Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (PMEL)", "exactMatch" : ["http://seadatanet.maris2.nl/v_edmo/print.asp?n_code=1440"], "hiddenLabel" : [{"_value" : "PMEL", "_lang" : "en"}
