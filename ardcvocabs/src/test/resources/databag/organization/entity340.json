It was established in the early 1960s to promote multi-disciplinary research into marine resources, with an emphasis on the economic analysis of fisheries. Since then it has developed into an international centre for the multi-disciplinary research of aquatic resources and is actively involved in research, consultancy, training and advanced studies, particularly in fisheries economics. The areas of expertise have expanded to include aquaculture economics and management, recreational fisheries, freshwater fisheries and coastal zone management. In addition, the Centre provides economic, institutional and legal specialisations within the broad area of the management of aquatic resources. The results of research and consultancies are published in core scientific journals and Centre staff also produce a wide range of in-house publications, copies of which are available on request. CEMARE staff and students enjoy full access to the wide range of library, technical and computing services offered by the University, and the Centre keeps an extensive collection of books, reports and journals, maintained by experienced library and technical staff. CEMARE's collection includes material on fisheries economics, as well as material on related subjects. We also have access to various specialist databases such as ASFA (Aquatic Sciences and Fisheries Abstracts). The Centre has active collaborative links at national, regional and international level with a wide range of government, inter-governmental and non-governmental organisations, as well as with other universities and research organisations. Individual members of CEMARE are affiliated to and active participants of the European Association of Fisheries Economists (EAFE), the International Institute of Fisheries Economics and Trade (IIFET), the Institute of Fisheries Management (IFM), Eurocoast UK, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) and the International Association for the Study of Common Property (IASCP). CEMARE staff have substantial experience of research, consultancy and postgraduate training in many aspects of commercial and recreational fisheries, and have primary responsibility for running the Postgraduate Programme in Fisheries Economics and Management.", "displayLabel" : "Centre for the Economics and Management of Aquatic Resources (CEMARE)", "exactMatch" : ["http://seadatanet.maris2.nl/v_edmo/print.asp?n_code=2925"], "hiddenLabel" : [{"_value" : "CEMARE", "_lang" : "en"}
