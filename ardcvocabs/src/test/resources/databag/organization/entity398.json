It is building a new data discovery tool using two complementary networks and will expand these by using an advanced technical architecture, capable of linking with many potential data resources. Biodiversity.aq is recognised as an official SCAR Product and integrates SCAR-MarBIN (Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research - Marine Biodiversity Information Network), with the biodiversity databases managed by the Australian Antarctic Division, bringing together data from marine and terrestrial realms. biodiversity.aq is the data management tool and repository for the biodiversity-related research conducted at the Princess Elisabeth Station. Biodiversity.aq will use the best available technology to integrate, share and disseminate all available information on Antarctic Biodiversity. Its implementation by the Belgian Biodiversity Platform ascertains that biodiversity.aq can take advantage of the relevant experience of the Belgian GBIF node. biodiversity.aq is steered by an International Steering Committee composed of selected experts in the field of Polar biodiversity.", "exactMatch" : ["http://seadatanet.maris2.nl/v_edmerp/print.asp?n_code=12142"], "hiddenLabel" : [{"_value" : "ANTABIF", "_lang" : "en"}
