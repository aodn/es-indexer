The BMR (Bureau of Mineral Resources, Geology and Geophysics) became the Australian Geological Survey Organisation (AGSO) in 1992. AGSO provided much of the geoscience information that underpinned exploration and development work for petroleum and minerals in Australia. A review carried out in AGSO's infancy concluded that geoscience was relevant to society by providing information essential for economic prosperity and for the proper use of resources to protect the local and global economy. In November 2001, the combined agencies adopted the current name of Geoscience Australia, recognising vital geoscientific work in a wide range of contexts and across many disciplines. The National Mapping and Geohazards Divisions of Geoscience Australia merged in 2005 to reflect a global trend in dealing with an increasing range of real world phenomena. Under the new Geospatial and Earth Monitoring Division (GEMD), the maintenance of standard small scale national topographic mapping remains a major responsibility.", "hiddenLabel" : [{"_value" : "AGSO", "_lang" : "en"}
