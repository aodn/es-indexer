Success in this mission will deliver our goal, to establish NOC as a major national and international centre of excellence for research, teaching and training in marine and earth science and in marine technology. Research work is conducted through a variety of organisations. Data are retained in a variety of forms and individual members of staff of the Department should be contacted for particular data.

PANGAEA® aims at collecting, scrutinising, and disseminating geo-referenced data about natural and anthropogenic components and functions in ecosystems at scales ranging from individual organisms, mesoscale features (e.g. upwelling, eddies, seamounts, coral reefs), and oceanic basin to global planetary scales. Core services supplied by PANGAEA® are scientific data management, long-term data archiving, data publication, and data dissemination via visualisation and analysis software and via interoperability with other European and international data dissemination systems. Data management includes quality control of metadata and the development of ontologies and vocabularies according to international protocols and standards. PANGAEA® has further defined work flows and technologies to allow automatic ingestion of data from marine observatories based on OGC standards ( (SWE - Sensor Web Enablement). Metadata are extensive and each dataset is citable and accessible by Digital Object Identifier (DOI). Datasets published by PANGAEA® are extremely diverse and include for example water column profiles, sediment core profiles, biogeographic distributions, meteorological and oceanographic time series, vital rate measurements on individual organisms or communities, sea bed photographs, audio and video records, and ROV surveys. PANGAEA® integrates biological data on plankton (including viruses, bacteria, autotrophic and heterotophic protists, crustaceans and jellyfish), fish, corals, micro-, meio- and macrobenthos, marine mammals and birds. In addition to contemporary observations we offer an extensive paleobiogeographic record from marine sediment cores. Biological data include key biodiversity parameters such as taxon-specific abundance and biomass, and also an extensive range of parameters describing the life history and vital rates of marine life. PANGAEA® is accredited as a World Data Centre by the International Council for Sciences (ICSU) World Data System (WDS) and accredited as World Radiation Monitoring Centre (WRMC) by the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) as part of their WMO Information System. At present PANGAEA® holds metadata and data for more than 300.000 datasets comprising more than 6 billion data items for more than 80.000 different measurement types (parameters), more than 17.000 principal investigators (authors), and around 20.000 references to journal articles. The system is operated in the sense of the Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities which is a follow up to the Budapest Open Access Initiative. Some ongoing projects are under moratorium so that access to data may be restricted, but metadata is always freely accessible.", "prefLabel" : {"_value" : "PANGAEA - Data Publisher for Earth and Environmental Science", "_lang" : "en"}

The institute also facilitates and supports marine research and education in the Netherlands and Europe. In order to fulfil its mission, the institute performs tasks in three specific fields: Research: The emphasis is on innovative and independent fundamental research in continental seas and open oceans. The institute also carries out research based on societal questions when this merges well with its fundamental work. The senior scientists at NIOZ all participate in international research projects. Education: The institute educates PhD and other students of universities and schools for professional education. Together universities NIOZ also organises courses for PhD students and master students in the marine sciences. A number of our senior scientists is also appointed as professor at Dutch and foreign universities. Facilitary services: NIOZ invites marine scientists from Dutch and foreign institutes and universities to write scientific proposals involving the institute\u2019s research vessels, laboratories, and the large research equipment, which is often designed and built by the institute\u2019s own technical department. The basic oceanographic disciplines at NIOZ are physics, chemistry, biology and geology. Multidisciplinary research is regarded as one of the main strengths of the institute.
