Many very talented people in a variety of disciplines have studied or worked at the university during the 390 years of its existence, including a Nobel Prize winner, the first female University student in the Netherlands and the first female lecturer, the first Dutch astronaut and the first president of the European Bank. They share their academic roots with more than 200,000 other people who have attended the University of Groningen as students, lecturers or research workers. The young University of Groningen was already an outstanding example of an international community in the seventeenth century. Almost half of the students and lecturers came from outside the Netherlands \u2013 the first Rector Magnificus, Ubbo Emmius, was German, for instance \u2013 but at the same time there was already a close relationship between the university and the city and the surrounding region. The founding of the university \u2013 at that time still a college of higher education \u2013 was an initiative taken by the Regional Assembly of the city of Groningen and the Ommelanden, or surrounding region. There were four faculties \u2013 Theology, Law, Medicine and Philosophy. The first 75 years of its existence were very fruitful for the university with about 100 students enrolling every year. The development of the university came to a standstill at the end of the seventeenth and during the eighteenth century because of theological differences of opinion, a difficult relationship with the Regional Assembly and political problems that included the siege of the city by \u2018Bommen Berend\u2019 in 1672. On average two to three hundred students were registered with the university at any one time during this period. Petrus Camper, though, was a shining academic example during the second half of the eighteenth century and was famous far beyond the city limits as an anatomist, a fighter against rinderpest and the founder of the first outpatient\u2019s clinic for surgical medicine. Opportunities and threats followed on each other\u2019s heels during the nineteenth century. In 1815, at the same time as Leiden and Utrecht, the university gained recognition as a national college of higher education, but this was followed by discussions about closure. The situation improved markedly when a new main university building, the Academiegebouw, was constructed in 1850, a building that was largely financed by the people of Groningen. This made the fire that completely destroyed this building in 1906 even more poignant. In the meantime, the Higher Education Act of 1876 had radically improved the position of the university, which was renamed the Rijksuniversiteit Groningen (RUG). Teaching now took place in Dutch as well as in Latin and the University was given a research as well as an educational duty. This laid the foundations for the present research university. The University of Groningen developed apace during the first decades of the twentieth century. The number of faculties and courses grew steadily while the number of students showed an explosive growth. When the university celebrated its first 300 years in 1914 there were 611 registered students; this had already grown to 1000 by 1924. After a drop back during the Depression, and in particular during the Second World War, the number of students grew rapidly from 1945 to reach 20,000 in 1994. At the present time there are about 21,000 students registered at the University of Groningen with the number of foreign students again growing steadily, and following the tradition set by the first Rector Magnificus, the number of German students and researchers has grown strongly in recent years.", "narrower" : [{"_about" : "http://vocab.aodn.org.au/def/organisation/entity/357", "prefLabel" : {"_value" : "Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, University of Groningen", "_lang" : "en"}
