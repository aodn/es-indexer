NIOZ is part of the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO). The institute employs around 220 people and the annual budget is approximately \u20ac20 million. The mission of NIOZ is to gain and communicate scientific knowledge on seas and oceans for the understanding and sustainability of our planet. The institute also facilitates and supports marine research and education in the Netherlands and Europe. In order to fulfil its mission, the institute performs tasks in three specific fields: Research: The emphasis is on innovative and independent fundamental research in continental seas and open oceans. The institute also carries out research based on societal questions when this merges well with its fundamental work. The senior scientists at NIOZ all participate in international research projects. Education: The institute educates PhD and other students of universities and schools for professional education. Together universities NIOZ also organises courses for PhD students and master students in the marine sciences. A number of our senior scientists is also appointed as professor at Dutch and foreign universities. Facilitary services: NIOZ invites marine scientists from Dutch and foreign institutes and universities to write scientific proposals involving the institute\u2019s research vessels, laboratories, and the large research equipment, which is often designed and built by the institute\u2019s own technical department. The basic oceanographic disciplines at NIOZ are physics, chemistry, biology and geology. Multidisciplinary research is regarded as one of the main strengths of the institute. There are 5 scientific departments: Physical Oceanography, Marine Geology, Marine Organic Biogeochemistry, Biological Oceanography and Marine Ecology.", "exactMatch" : ["http://seadatanet.maris2.nl/v_edmo/print.asp?n_code=630"], "inScheme" : {"_about" : "http://vocab.aodn.org.au/def/organisation/1", "hasTopConcept" : ["http://vocab.aodn.org.au/def/organisation/entity/389"]}
