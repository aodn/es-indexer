VIMS began operations in 1978. In July 1996 the Victorian Institute of Marine Sciences, along with two other marine and freshwater groups, became a part of the Marine and Freshwater Resources Institute (MAFRI). In 1998 the decision was made to repeal the Victorian Institute of Marine Sciences Act 1974 and to include the Institute as part of the Fisheries Division of the Department of Natural Resources and Environment. In 2002 it was handed over to the newly formed Department of Primary Industries.
