The ACE CRC is a partnership dedicated to sustainable management of Antarctic marine ecosystem resources and the study of atmospheric and oceanic processes of the Southern Ocean and their role in global and regional climate change. ACE CRC's Mission Statement: * Extend the existing research base in the Antarctic physical environment into the science of Southern Ocean and Antarctic ecosystem dynamics * Encourage sustainable management of Southern Ocean and Antarctic marine living resources * Connect physical variability and change in the Southern Ocean and Antarctica with their climate impacts on Australia and the surrounding region to permit efficient response and adaptation * Enhance Australian leadership in Antarctic affairs and advance Australia's objectives for its Antarctic Territory and Exclusive Economic Zones * Expand engagement of the international science community in Southern Ocean and Antarctic research relevant to Australia's interests to deliver the knowledge and information needed by our diverse research users * Encourage the realisation of policy and commercial opportunities in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean * Produce expertly-trained scientists with international experience, skills in research, its broad application and its role in enterprise and policy.", "exactMatch" : ["http://seadatanet.maris2.nl/v_edmo/print.asp?n_code=1490"], "hiddenLabel" : [{"_value" : "ACE CRC", "_lang" : "en"}
