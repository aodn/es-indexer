Over 900 dedicated employees, a budget of some 60 million Euro, and unique competence form a solid basis for our wide range of services:  * Services to maritime shipping, including tonnage measurement, law of the flag, International Shipping Register  * Promotion of the German commercial fleet  * Issue and registration of mariners' certificates  * Type-testing and approval of radiocommunications and navigation equipment * Surveys in the North and Baltic Seas performed by BSH vessels * Publication of nautical charts and small-craft charts * Approval of offshore activities, e.g. wind farms, pipelines, submarine cables * Prediction of tides, water levels, and storm surges  * Monitoring of the marine environment * Prosecution of environmental offences * Improvement of knowledge of the oceans. With its historical roots in the \"Norddeutsche Seewarte\" (North German Maritime Observatory) which issued detailed sailing directions based on nautical and meteorological observations as early as 1868, the BSH has long ceased to be only a provider of the traditional services to shipping but has focused on additional maritime target groups and applications - e.g. the offshore wind industry and marine environmental protection.", "prefLabel" : {"_value" : "Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency (BSH)", "_lang" : "en"}
