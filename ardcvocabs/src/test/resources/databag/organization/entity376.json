The mission of the Goddard Space Flight Center is to expand knowledge of the Earth and its environment, the solar system and the universe through observations from space. It is committed to excellence in scientific investigation, in the development and operation of space systems, and in the advancement of essential technologies. In pursuit of this challenge, the Center will: 1) Conduct a preeminent program of research in the space and Earth science disciplines using measurements from space complemented by suborbital, ground-based and laboratory measurements and by theoretical investigations. 2) Develop and operate a broad spectrum of flight missions that are responsive to the needs of the science community. 3) Provide and operate spaceflight tracking and data acquisition networks. 4) Develop innovative technology and instruments critical to the success of our mission. 5) Develop and maintain advanced information systems for the display, analysis, archiving and distribution of space and Earth science data. 6) Develop National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) satellite systems that provide environmental data for forecasting and research.", "exactMatch" : ["http://seadatanet.maris2.nl/v_edmo/print.asp?n_code=1225"], "hiddenLabel" : [{"_value" : "NASA GSFC", "_lang" : "en"}
