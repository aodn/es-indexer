It maintains a diverse range of interests, preparing students for careers in science, law and the humanities, offering both undergraduate and postgraduate studies. The primary focus is on both environmental science and earth processes. The Institute of Scientific Information (ISI) has ranked ANU geoscience the top university program in Australia, and amongst the top 10 universities worldwide. The Department is the only teaching department of Earth Sciences in Canberra, and its location provides a unique opportunity to collaborate with government departments such as Geoscience Australia and the Bureau of Rural Sciences. Thus, there is access to some of the most advanced equipment available for experimental work, and opportunities that no other university in Australia can offer. The Department is an active member of the Cooperative Research Centre for Landscape Environments and Mineral Exploration which sees some staff involved in teaching and research in hydrology, regolith geochemistry and biogeochemistry. The Department also holds the Office for the Consortium of Marine Geoscience Institutions for Australia and is the successor of the [now defunct] Australian Ocean Drilling Program with new aims for promoting marine geoscience in this country.", "displayLabel" : "Department of Earth and Marine Sciences (DEMS)", "exactMatch" : ["http://seadatanet.maris2.nl/v_edmo/print.asp?n_code=1492"], "hiddenLabel" : [{"_value" : "DEMS", "_lang" : "en"}
