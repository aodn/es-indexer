The University of Portsmouth is a research-active university with wide range of activities across many subjects. Areas of international excellence include the Institute of Biomedical and Biomolecular Sciences, the Centre for European and International Research and the Institute of Cosmology and Gravitation. We also have well-developed strengths in applied research with business, industry, and the public and voluntary sectors. We are proud of our teaching record, receiving the highest possible rating in the most recent Quality Assurance Agency audit.  The 2011 National Students Survey places Portsmouth within the top 30 mainstream English universities for overall satisfaction with 85 per cent of full-time students reporting being satisfied or very satisfied with their course, higher than the national average of 83 per cent. Applications to the University of Portsmouth increased by 20 per cent (28,448) in 2010 and by 26 per cent (23,632) in 2009 and we received a 13 per cent increase in research funding following success in the 2008 Research Assessment Exercise (RAE). The average increase across the sector was 8 per cent. The University has excellent links with industry and a strong record of student employability.

Since then it has developed into an international centre for the multi-disciplinary research of aquatic resources and is actively involved in research, consultancy, training and advanced studies, particularly in fisheries economics. The areas of expertise have expanded to include aquaculture economics and management, recreational fisheries, freshwater fisheries and coastal zone management. In addition, the Centre provides economic, institutional and legal specialisations within the broad area of the management of aquatic resources. The results of research and consultancies are published in core scientific journals and Centre staff also produce a wide range of in-house publications, copies of which are available on request. CEMARE staff and students enjoy full access to the wide range of library, technical and computing services offered by the University, and the Centre keeps an extensive collection of books, reports and journals, maintained by experienced library and technical staff. CEMARE's collection includes material on fisheries economics, as well as material on related subjects. We also have access to various specialist databases such as ASFA (Aquatic Sciences and Fisheries Abstracts). The Centre has active collaborative links at national, regional and international level with a wide range of government, inter-governmental and non-governmental organisations, as well as with other universities and research organisations. Individual members of CEMARE are affiliated to and active participants of the European Association of Fisheries Economists (EAFE), the International Institute of Fisheries Economics and Trade (IIFET), the Institute of Fisheries Management (IFM), Eurocoast UK, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) and the International Association for the Study of Common Property (IASCP).
