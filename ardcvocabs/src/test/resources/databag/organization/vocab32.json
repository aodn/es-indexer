Oceanweather's approach is to consistently develop and apply its high-level technology to satisfy practical requirements in the areas of marine meteorology, ocean wave and current specification, ocean engineering, and statistics of environmental data. In the past quarter century Oceanweather has performed dedicated hindcast studies and Joint Industry Projects (JIPs) in virtually every ocean basin in the world. Since 1983, Oceanweather has operated a real time forecasting division following a unique approach which optimally combines the traditional approach to weather forecasting, which retains the contributions of individual forecasters, and Oceanweather's high-level technology developed and applied so successfully in its hindcasting and consulting divisions. The system includes a global wind and wave forecast system and various high resolution regional applications.", "prefLabel" : {"_value" : "Oceanweather Inc.", "_lang" : "en"}
