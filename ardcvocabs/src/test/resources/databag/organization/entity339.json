Many of our academics are international leaders in their fields and our students learn from experts who are pushing forward the boundaries of knowledge. Our 19,000 students, including 3,000 from over 100 countries, are supported by over 3,000 staff. We offer superb facilities in a vibrant waterfront location \u2013 a university by the sea but in the heart of one of Britain's most historic cities. The main Guildhall campus, dotted around the city centre, has undergone extensive redevelopment with the establishment of a University Quarter. The University of Portsmouth is a research-active university with wide range of activities across many subjects. Areas of international excellence include the Institute of Biomedical and Biomolecular Sciences, the Centre for European and International Research and the Institute of Cosmology and Gravitation. We also have well-developed strengths in applied research with business, industry, and the public and voluntary sectors. We are proud of our teaching record, receiving the highest possible rating in the most recent Quality Assurance Agency audit.Â  The 2011 National Students Survey places Portsmouth within the top 30 mainstream English universities for overall satisfaction with 85 per cent of full-time students reporting being satisfied or very satisfied with their course, higher than the national average of 83 per cent. Applications to the University of Portsmouth increased by 20 per cent (28,448) in 2010 and by 26 per cent (23,632) in 2009 and we received a 13 per cent increase in research funding following success in the 2008 Research Assessment Exercise (RAE). The average increase across the sector was 8 per cent. The University has excellent links with industry and a strong record of student employability. The University recruitment agency, Purple Door Careers and Recruitment, offers a wide range of careers resources, skills workshops, careers guidance, and employer events to support students and graduates in gaining graduate employment. Our experienced recruitment consultants work in collaboration with local and national businesses, charities, and organisations to source graduate opportunities and assist graduates at every step of the recruitment process. We have a clear focus on Enterprise, and our Centre for Enterprise, established in 2000, aims to inspire Portsmouth students to learn and succeed in entrepreneurship, offering free training and mentoring to both former and current students. Arts and Humanities are additional areas of strength; the Faculty of Creative and Cultural Industries meets the need for talented graduates of the fast-growing creative and cultural sector of the regional and national economy.", "exactMatch" : ["http://seadatanet.maris2.nl/v_edmo/print.asp?n_code=2924"], "inScheme" : {"_about" : "http://vocab.aodn.org.au/def/organisation/1", "hasTopConcept" : ["http://vocab.aodn.org.au/def/organisation/entity/339"]}
