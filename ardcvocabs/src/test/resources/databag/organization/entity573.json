Two of these, research and social contribution, are apt to change in response to global trends. Education, however, has an essential nature that I believe to be unchangeable. In line with its commitment to independent learning, Kyoto University must maintain its position as a bastion of academic freedom, slightly detached from general society and unconstrained by convention. In order to do so, the university must be a place where academic endeavor can proceed undisturbed, while also providing windows into the world and society. These windows can be opened by faculty members equipped with cutting-edge knowledge of the world and society that lies beyond, but the most important role in our university is played by students who venture outside the windows. We must work carefully with partners in industry and government to provide windows that allow students to make the best practical use of abilities they have developed at the university.", "exactMatch" : ["http://seadatanet.maris2.nl/v_edmo/print.asp?n_code=5163"], "inScheme" : {"_about" : "http://vocab.aodn.org.au/def/organisation/1", "hasTopConcept" : ["http://vocab.aodn.org.au/def/organisation/entity/573"]}
