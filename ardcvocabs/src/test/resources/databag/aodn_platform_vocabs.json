The second function is that a vaisala WXT520 weather station is mounted on the top and so this pole provides above water met observations. These include air temperature, humidity, air pressure, wind speed and direction and rainfall. The third function is that a sensor string is attached to the pole, the sensor string runs through a channel in Seabird Islet across the exposed seaward reef flat to the reef crest and then down the reef slope to around 20m. This gives a profile down the reef slope and gives readings of the water coming onto the reef complex. The pole has two Campbell Scientific loggers (one for the weather station, one for the sensors), spread-spectrum radio and 2.4/5 GHz 802.11 wireless for communicating with the base station (located at the workshop near the Research Station). The sensor string as of August 2010 has a SeaBird SBE37 at the end of the sensor string (around 230m out from the pole), and two SeaBird SBE39's located at teh reef crest and down at the start of the reef slope.

The wind speed and direction and processed into scalar and vector (directional) based readings and presented as 10 and 30 minute averages to give mean values and maximum values.

Instruments are located on this riser to give a profile through the water column. The station is designed to measure temperature of the water column at the front of the reef and in particular to detect upwelling and other events where warmer bottom water is pushed across the shelf onto the reefs. This not only indicates processes operating across the shelf but also conditions when coral bleaching may be more common. The buoy was decommissioned in July 2017.",
