The third function is that a sensor string is attached to the pole, the sensor string runs through a channel in Seabird Islet across the exposed seaward reef flat to the reef crest and then down the reef slope to around 20m. This gives a profile down the reef slope and gives readings of the water coming onto the reef complex.

The weather station is connected via an SDI-12 interface to a Campbell Scientific CR1000 logger which uses a RF411 radio to transmit the data, every 10 minutes, to the base station on Heron Island and then a Telstra nextG link is used to send the data back to AIMS.

In December 2011, a replacement buoy was deployed with the above water sensors being the existing AIMS weather station units and the in-water sensors being provided under the IMOS funded GBROOS project. This resulted in a data gap between the cyclone in February 2011 and the buoy being deployed in December 2011. It is antcipated that the AIMS weather station will be restored in late 2012 in which case the above water sensors will transition back to the AIMS tower with the in-water sensors remaining as part of the IMOS funded work.
