  "description": "The Bonney Coast (BONC) HF ocean radar system covers an area of the Bonney Coast, South Australia, which has a recurring annual upwelling feature near to the coast that significantly changes the ecosystem from one of warm water originating in Western Australia, to one dominated by cold upwelling water from off the continental shelf.  The dynamics of this area and the relationship between ocean circulation, chemistry and sediments control the larval species and the higher marine species and ecosystems in which they forage.  \n\nThe data from this site provide linking observations between the Southern Ocean and NSW through processes that occur on weekly to El Nino time scales.  \n\nThe BONC HF ocean radar system consists of two SeaSonde crossed loop direction finding stations located at Nora Creina (37.329 S 139.850 E) and Blackfellows Cave (37.940 S 140.457 E).  These radars operate at a frequency of 5.211 MHz, with a bandwidth of 50 KHz, a maximum range of 200 Km\nand a range resolution of 3 Km.  Within the HF radar coverage area surface currents are measured.\n\nThis site was decommissioned in March 2017.",

      "title": "{\"title\":\"IMOS - ACORN - Direction finding ocean radar system (Seasonde)\",\"recordAbstract\":\"Coastal ocean surface radar is a land-based technique which uses scattering from the rough sea surface to obtain echoes which are Doppler shifted by the dynamics of the sea. It has been shown (Crombie, 1955) that the scatter is predominantly a Bragg interaction between the radio wave and the sea surface gravity wave that is propagating in the same direction and with half the wavelength of the radio wave. This Bragg interaction gives two strong first-order lines in the echo spectrum; one from the resonant gravity wave moving radially away from the station, and one from the resonant gravity wave moving towards the station.\\n\\nDirection-finding systems determine the azimuthal direction of a source point by comparing amplitude and phase signals on crossed loop receive antennas. The direction finding calculation is done on Doppler shift spectra for a specified range which includes return echoes from all azimuths. This means that the spectra are spread and second-order echoes from one direction are swamped by the first-order echoes from other directions. Consequently, parameter extraction using second-order echoes is not possible on a routine basis. Directional wave spectra at the location of each radar station are produced by analysing the full azimuthal spread of first-order echo amplitudes, and wind directions are derived across the grid points by taking the ratio of the positive and negative Bragg echoes.\\n\\nSeaSonde HF ocean radar stations are used on the Turquoise Coast (Seabird and Cervantes), Western Australia, and on the Bonney Coast (Nora Creina and Blackfellows Cave), South Australia.\"}"

      "title": "{\"title\":\"IMOS - ACORN - Turquoise Coast HF ocean radar site (Western Australia, Australia)\",\"recordAbstract\":\"The Turquoise Coast (TURQ) HF ocean radar system covers the area of shelf between Seabird and Jurien Bay and is the logical continuation of major research efforts to understand the role of the Leeuwin Current System (Leeuwin Current, the Leeuwin Undercurrent and Capes Current) in controlling not only the physical system but also its links to both pelagic and benthic ecosystems. In contrast to eastern ocean basins, which are highly productive, Western Australia experiences an oligotrophic environment. The Leeuwin Current is a shallow (<300 m deep), narrow band (< 100 km wide) of warm, lower salinity, nutrient depleted water of tropical origin that flows poleward from Exmouth to Cape Leeuwin and into the Great Australian Bight. The Current plays a dominant role in controlling the marine life and climate of the region. \\n\\nQuestions which may be addressed by using the HF ocean radar data from TURQ (and ROT) include the variability of the Leeuwin current and its response to the ENSO cycle; Leeuwin Current eddies and their interaction with the shelf waters; and the interaction between the Leeuwin Current, the Capes Current and coastal current during the summer. This is an important region for Western Rock lobster recruitment, and the meanders of the warm Leeuwin Current influence the ecology. This is a region with low tidal range and with a coastline subject to strong sea breezes and intense winter storms. Coastally trapped waves may be generated by the winter weather systems and by tropical cyclones in the summer. \\n\\nThe TURQ HF ocean radar system consists of two SeaSonde crossed loop direction finding stations located at Seabird (31.281 S 115.444 E) and Cervantes (30.506 S 115.060E). From 2012-12-15T11:00:00 the Cervantes station has been replaced by the Green Head station (30.073 S 114.967E) and from 2013-03-19T00:00:00 the Seabird station has been replaced by the Lancelin station (31.027 S 115.328 E). These radars operate at a frequency of 5.211 MHz, with a bandwidth of 50 KHz, a maximum range of 200 Km\\nand a range resolution of 3 Km. Within the HF radar coverage area surface currents are measured.\\n\\nThe TURQ area of coverage has a small overlap of commonly observed ocean with the Rottnest Shelf (ROT) WERA HF ocean radar system on its south side; and with the Coral Coast (CORL) HF ocean radar system on its north side.
