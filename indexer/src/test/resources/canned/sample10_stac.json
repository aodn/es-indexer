  "title": "IMOS - Australian National Mooring Network (ANMN) Facility - Current velocity time-series",
  "description": "The Australian National Mooring Network (ANMN) Facility is a series of national reference stations and regional moorings designed to monitor particular oceanographic phenomena in Australian coastal ocean waters. This collection contains time-series observations of current velocity from moorings deployed by the ANMN. The primary parameters are the zonal, meridional and vertical components of the current speed within different bins in the water column, the height above the instrument of each bin, the pressure (when available) and depth at the instrument. Temperature at the instrument is also usually measured. The observations were made using a range of Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) and Acoustic Doppler Current Meter (single point measurement) instruments. We are also producing a gridded product of sea water velocity time-series based on these data. These will be available in a separate collection.",

Extended by IMOS from three to nine sites around the entire Australian continent, the stations report integrated biological, chemical and physical oceanography time series observations, upon which more intensive local and regional scale studies can be referenced against. The regional moorings monitor the interaction between boundary currents and shelf water masses and their consequent impact upon ocean productivity (e.g. Perth Canyon Upwelling; Kangaroo Island Upwelling) and ecosystem distribution and resilience (e.g. Coral Sea interaction with the Great Barrier Reef ). Operation of the network is distributed between several operators and coordinated nationally.\\n\\nPassive acoustic listening station arrays are located at three sites. These stations provide baseline data on ambient oceanic noise, detection of fish and mammal vocalizations and detection of underwater events. The Acidification Moorings are co-located at three of the National Reference Stations, and provide key observations to help us understand and address the problem of increasing ocean acidification.\"}"

Moorings in the region also monitor processes within the Perth Canyon. The time-series monitoring of physical and biological parameters provided by these moorings supplements past and current research activities in the region based at the CSIRO, the Department of Fisheries WA and Western Australian Universities. The sub-facility currently maintains six regional moorings (two recently decommissioned) and two National Reference Stations (one recently retrieved and not redeployed).\\n \\nThe regional moorings are located off Perth, clustered near the Perth Canyon and the Two Rocks Line. The Two Rocks Line contains four moorings which transect the continental shelf north of Perth from the 44m to the 500m isobath (the 50m mooring was decommissioned in May 2013, and the 150m mooring in October 2013). Around the Perth Canyon, there remains one shelf mooring in shallower water at the head of the canyon, formerly two slope moorings were located near the 500m isobath (decommissioned in July 2010 and March 2014), to monitor processes in and around the canyon. Primarily these moorings are thermistor strings allowing the structure of the Leeuwin Current to be determined. Two of the moorings also sample biogeochemical parameters.\"}"

The mooring arrays provide near real time and delayed mode observations from oceanographic moorings comprising physical (temperature, salinity, sea level and currents) and on most moorings, water quality measurements (turbidity, fluorescence, dissolved oxygen). \\n\\nThe GBR array (extends an earlier long term observing program) is located along the outer Great Barrier Reef in order to monitor the Western Boundary currents of the Coral Sea comprising the poleward East Australian Current (EAC) and the equator-ward Gulf of Papua Current. Four mooring pairs consist of a continental slope mooring in 70 to 300m of water and its partner on the outer continental shelf within the reef matrix in depths of 30 to 70m. The array is designed to detect any changes in circulation, temperature response, mixed layer depth and ocean-shelf exchanges. \\n\\nWAIMOS observations in the north west of Australia commenced in June 2010 with the roll out of 4 moorings from Joseph Bonaparte Gulf to the Timor slope. These continental shelf moorings complement a deep water array monitoring the Indonesian Throughflow in the Timor Tough and Ombai Strait operated by the Deep Water Moorings Facility (formerly known as the Australian Bluewater Observing System). This array was decommissioned in 2019, and equipment was moved to a new array on the North West Shelf. In early 2012 two more arrays were added off the Kimberley and Pilbara continental shelf regions (these were discontinued in August 2014). The arrays are looking to monitor boundary currents such as the Holloway and Leeuwin Currents. Cross-shelf exchanges are also observed in these high energy macro-tidal and internal wave dominated shelves. \\n\\nIn 2013 in partnership with the Darwin Port Corp, the Northern Territory Government a new real time mooring was located in Beagle Gulf (this mooring was decommissioned in July 2017). The Palm Passage mooring on the GBR was upgraded to near-real-time in February 2013.\"}"

These moorings are deployed to continuously monitor the large seasonal coastal upwelling of water that occurs along the region's continental shelf during summer. This upwelling brings cold, nutrient rich waters onto the shelf which boosts primary productivity, creating one of the most productive coastal marine ecosystems in Australian waters. The five moorings measure an array of physical and biological properties and are a combination of four regional moorings and a National Reference Station (biological sampling at SAM5CB, SAM8SG, SAMGSV, SAMUSG and NRS).\\n\\nThe regional moorings consist of one shelf mooring located on the same isobath as the NRS and in the path of the upwelled/downwelled exchange, a mooring located near the mouth of Spencer Gulf to measure possible winter outflow of saline rich water, and two moorings situated in Upper Spencer Gulf and Gulf St Vincent. The NRS is located at a convergence point of isobaths and monitors upwelling and outflow events as well as long-term variations in the strength of the coastal current.\\n\\nThere are six discontinued moorings that were once part of this sub-facility, for which data is still available: M1 Deep Slope Mooring (SAM1DS) and M6 Investigator Strait Mooring (SAM6IS) were both discontinued in 2009, M4 Canyon Mooring (SAM4CY) and M2 Cabbage Patch Mooring (SAM2CP) were both discontinued in 2010, and M4 Mid-Slope Mooring (SAM3MS) and M7 Deep-Slope Mooring (SAM7DS) which were discontinued in 2013-2014.\"}"

This region is typically downstream of where the East Australian Current (EAC) separates from the coast, and is often influenced by EAC eddies. Data collection supports research on the marine ecosystems associated with these eddies and, as the sub-facility is located in the most densely populated area of Australia, issues such as water quality, waste disposal, shipping hazards, harmful algal blooms and recreation are also of particular research interest.\\n\\nThe sub-facility has also deployed two moorings across the shelf at Coffs Harbour in the north of NSW, and a pair of moorings at the Bateman's Marine Park, off Narooma in the south. These moorings will enhance the ANMN coverage along the coast of south-eastern Australia and also provide long term monitoring of the continental shelf region both upstream and downstream of the EAC separation point.\"}"

Through an analysis of these signals, it is possible to discriminate and identify different species and to assess the number of animals present within the range of acoustic observation, which can then be linked to ocean productivity. Large animals can also be located by a horizontal array of sea noise loggers constituting a passive acoustic observatory. IMOS operated acoustic observatories at four sites: 1) Perth Canyon in Western Australia, 2) off Portland in South Australia, 3) near Tuncurry (Forster) in New South Wales, and 4) west of Kangaroo Island in South Australia (these sites were decommissioned in 2017/2018).
