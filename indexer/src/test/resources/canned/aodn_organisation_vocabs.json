The second function is that a vaisala WXT520 weather station is mounted on the top and so this pole provides above water met observations. These include air temperature, humidity, air pressure, wind speed and direction and rainfall. The third function is that a sensor string is attached to the pole, the sensor string runs through a channel in Seabird Islet across the exposed seaward reef flat to the reef crest and then down the reef slope to around 20m. This gives a profile down the reef slope and gives readings of the water coming onto the reef complex.

The buoy is configured as a sensor-float with a Campbell Scientific logger, a spread-spectrum radio for communicating with the base station (located near the Research Station) a surface mounted (60cm under the water surface) thermistor and an inductive modem to support a range of inductive sensors, initialy this will be a SeaBird SBE39 measuring temperature and pressure (depth). The float is moored at the entrance to Little Pioneer Bay, just deep of the reef front and will be used to measure the water entering the bay with particular interest in warm water pushing up into the bay. The data will support work being done in the bay by James Cook University researchers. This float was decommissioned in June 2022.",

The buoy has an Inductive Modem (IM) line that extends from the buoy to the bottom and then along the bottom for around 50 m and then rises to flotation located 9 m below the surface. Instruments are located on this riser to give a profile through the water column. The station is designed to measure temperature of the water column at the front of the reef and in particular to detect upwelling and other events where warmer bottom water is pushed across the shelf onto the reefs. This not only indicates processes operating across the shelf but also conditions when coral bleaching may be more common. The buoy was decommissioned in July 2017.",

This resulted in a data gap between the cyclone in February 2011 and the buoy being deployed in December 2011. It is antcipated that the AIMS weather station will be restored in late 2012 in which case the above water sensors will transition back to the AIMS tower with the in-water sensors remaining as part of the IMOS funded work.
