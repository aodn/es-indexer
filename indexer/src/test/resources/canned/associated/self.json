  "description" : "The Animal Tracking Facility (formerly known as the Australian Animal Tracking And Monitoring System (AATAMS)) is a coordinated marine animal tagging project. Satellite Relay Data Loggers (SRDL) (most with CTDs, and some also with fluorometers) are used to explore how marine mammal behaviour relates to their oceanic environment. Loggers developed at the University of St Andrews Sea Mammal Research Unit transmit data in near real time via the Argo satellite system. The Satellite Relay Data Loggers are deployed on marine mammals, including Elephant Seals, Weddell Seals, Australian Fur Seals, Australian Sea Lions, New Zealand Fur Seals. Data parameters measured by the instruments include time, conductivity (salinity), temperature, speed, fluorescence (available in the future) and depth. Data is being collected in the Southern Ocean, the Great Australian Bight, and off the South-East Coast of Australia.",

    "title" : "{\"title\":\"IMOS - Animal Tracking Facility\",\"recordAbstract\":\"The IMOS Animal Tracking Facility (formerly known as the Australian Animal Tracking And Monitoring System (AATAMS)) represents the higher biological monitoring of the marine environment for the IMOS program. Currently the facility uses acoustic technology, CTD satellite trackers and bio loggers to monitor coastal and oceanic movements of marine animals from the Australian mainland to the sub-Antarctic islands and as far south as the Antarctic continent. Acoustic monitoring is a powerful tool for observing tagged marine animals with networks or cross shelf arrays (curtains) of receivers, allowing animals to be monitored over scales of hundreds of metres to thousands of kilometres. An array or network consists of a series of acoustic receivers that are strategically deployed on the sea floor for 1 to 10 years (depending on receiver type and battery life) with the ability to download data from the receivers as often as required. NCRIS and partner investments will target areas identified by regional nodes. VR2's deployed in conjunction with other moorings will provide information on long range movement of a variety of species including endangered and protected species (i.e. White Sharks and Grey Nurse Sharks), and valuable commercial species (i.e. Tuna) Curtains are mobile and can be deployed in different configurations for specific IMOS projects. The continued coordination of acoustic tag codes between researchers means that acoustic array around Australia will provide the combined infrastructure to monitor movement of highly migratory marine species between all jurisdictions. CTD satellite trackers and bio loggers currently deployed on a large range of animals are collecting a wide range of data. This includes behavioural and physical data such as the depth, temperature, salinity and movement effort of individual marine animals. The Animal Tracking Facility is set up to collect data over a long period of time. This sustained approach will enable researchers to assess the effects of climate change, ocean acidification and other physical changes that affect animals within the marine environment.\"}"

Simultaneously, the Animal Tracking Facility developed a centralised national database (https://animaltracking.aodn.org.au/) to encourage collaborative research across the Australian research community and provide unprecedented opportunities to quantify individual behaviour across a broad range of taxa. This static dataset presents the first 10 years (2007 - 2017) of quality-controlled animal detections collated via the IMOS Australian Animal Acoustic Telemetry Database. The dataset comprises 48.5 million valid detections collected at 1891 receiving stations around Australia, and consists of detection data for 3523 tags deployed on 117 species (fish, sharks, rays, reptiles, and mammals), with distances travelled ranging from a few to thousands of kilometres. To access subsequent additions in a dynamic database, please refer to the following metadata record: https://catalogue-imos.aodn.org.au/geonetwork/srv/api/records/541d4f15-122a-443d-ab4e-2b5feb08d6a0\"}"

Satellite Relay Data Loggers (SRDL) (most with CTDs, and some also with fluorometers) are used to explore how marine mammal behaviour relates to their oceanic environment. Loggers developed at the University of St Andrews Sea Mammal Research Unit transmit data in near real time via the Argo satellite system. The Satellite Relay Data Loggers are deployed on marine mammals, including Elephant Seals, Weddell Seals, Australian Fur Seals, Australian Sea Lions, New Zealand Fur Seals. Data is being collected in the Southern Ocean, the Great Australian Bight, and off the South-East Coast of Australia. This metadata record, represents several different datasets listed hereafter, which can all be accessed through a multi-WFS service. The data represented by this record are presented in delayed mode. CTD - parameters measured by the instruments include time, conductivity (salinity), temperature, speed, fluorescence (available in the future) and depth. Diving - parameters measured by the instruments include start and end time and longitude/latitude of each individual dive, post-dive surface duration, dive duration, maximum dive depth, intermediate dive depths and times. Haulout - a haulout begins when the SRDL has been continuously dry for a specified length of time (usually 10 minutes). It ends when continuously wet for another interval (usually 40 seconds). Haulout data parameters measured by the instruments include haulout start and end dates and longitude/latitude, and haulout number. Argos locations - location data parameters measured by the instruments include time, longitude, latitude, location quality, along with other diagnostic information provided by Argos (http://www.argos-system.org/). Summary Statistics - as well as sending records of individual events such as dives and haulouts, the SRDL also calculates summary statistics of those events over a specified time period (usually 3, 4 or 6 hours). Summary statistics computed by the instruments include the proportion of time spent diving, at the surface and hauled-out, the number of dives, and the average, standard deviation and maximum dive duration and dive depth during each summary period. These statistics are based on all the data recorded by the SRDL and so are not prone to distortion by variations in the efficiency of transmission via Argos. ** For data after October 2018, please consult IMOS - Animal Tracking Facility - Satellite Relay Tagging Program - Delayed mode data with quality-controlled locations (https://catalogue-imos.aodn.org.au:443/geonetwork/srv/api/records/70f148b1-7040-4fad-944a-456413c95472), to access data with improved satellite locations. In the near future all historical delayed mode data will be reprocessed with the new quality control (QC) process, to improve the accuracy of the satellite location data, and this dataset will be replaced by the new QCâ€™d one. **\"}"
