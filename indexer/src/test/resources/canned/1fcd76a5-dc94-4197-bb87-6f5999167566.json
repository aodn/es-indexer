  "title": "Bacterial community structure in the soft coral, Alcyonium antarcticum from Antarctica",
  "description": "The structure and composition of microbial communities inhabiting the soft coral Alcyonium antarcticum were investigated across 3 differentially contaminated sites within McMurdo Sound, Antarctica - McMurdo Station (MM), Scott Base (SB) and Cape Armitage (CA).Samples from all sites were subjected to culture-based analysis, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), 16S rRNA gene clone-library analysis, and (FISH).Phylogenetic groups included Gamma-, Alpha- and Beta- proteobacteria; Bacteroidetes; Firmicutes; Actinomycetales; Planctomycetes; and Chlorobi and bacteria from the functional group of sulfate-reducing bacteria.\n To investigate the structure and composition of microbial communities inhabiting the soft coral Alcyonium antarcticum.To examine any variation within and between Alcyonium antarcticum bacterial communities from 3 differentially contaminated sites within McMurdo Sound, Antarctica .\n This was the first investigation of microbial communities associated with Antarctic soft corals.Accession numbers assigned to sequencing products: Culture1-Culture10 (DG312224, DG312225, DG312226, DG312227, DG312228, DG312229, DG312230, DG312231, DG312232, DG312233); OTU1-OTU15 (DG312234, DG312235, DG312236, DG312237, DG312238, DG312239, DG312240, DG312241, DG312242, DG312243, DG312244, DG312245, DG312246, DG312247, DG312248); DGGE Band1-Band11, (DG312249, DG312250, DG312251, DG312252, DG312253, DG312254, DG312255, DG312256, DG312257, DG312258) and Band14-Band16 (DG312259, DG312260, DG312261).",
