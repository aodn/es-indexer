  "description": "This dataset summarises benthic surveys in Yanyuwa Sea Country into 3 GIS shapefiles.\n                    (1) A point (site) shapefile describes seagrass presence/absence at 3248 sites surveyed by small vessel and helicopter.\n                    (2) The meadow shapefile describes attributes of 180 intertidal seagrass meadows.\n                    (3) The interpolation GeoTiff describes variation in seagrass biomass across the seagrass meadows.\n\n                    This project is a partnership between li-Anthawirriyarra rangers, Charles Darwin University, James Cook University, and Mabunji Aboriginal Resource Indigenous Corporation to map the intertidal habitats of the Yanyuwa Indigenous Protected Area (IPA), an area of profound importance to the Marra and Yanyuwa people and to the marine ecosystem of the Gulf of Carpentaria. Benthic habitat maps of Yanyuwa Country were produced, with a focus on seagrass.\n\n                    Report reference: Groom R, Carter A, Collier C, Firby L, Evans S, Barrett S, Hoffmann L, van de Wetering C, Shepherd L, Evans S, Anderson S.

Available at: https://www.nespmarinecoastal.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/NESP-MaC-Hub-Project-1.12_Groom-et-al-FINAL-REPORT.pdf\n\n                    Methods:\n                    The sampling methods used to study, describe and monitor seagrass meadows were developed by the TropWATER Seagrass Group and tailored to the location and habitat surveyed; these are described in detail in the relevant publications (https://research.jcu.edu.au/tropwater).\n                    Geographic Information System (GIS)\n\n                    All survey data were entered into a Geographic Information System (GIS) developed for Torres Strait using ArcGIS 10.8. Rectified colour satellite imagery of Yanyuwa Sea Country (Source: Allen Coral Atlas and ESRI), field notes and aerial photographs taken from the helicopter during surveys were used to identify geographical features, such as reef tops, channels and deep-water drop-offs, to assist in determining seagrass meadow boundaries. Three GIS layers were created to describe spatial features of the region: a site layer, seagrass meadow layer, and a seagrass biomass interpolation layer.\n\n                    Seagrass site layer\n                    This layer contains information on data collected at assessment sites. This layer includes:\n                    1.\tTemporal survey details – Survey date;\n                    2.\tSpatial position - Latitude/longitude;\n                    3.\tSurvey location;\n                    4.\tSeagrass information including presence/absence of seagrass, above-ground biomass (total and for each species), percent cover of seagrass at each site and whether individual species were present/absent at a site;\n                    5.\tBenthic macro-invertebrate information including the percent cover of hard coral, soft coral, sponges and other benthic macro invertebrates (e.g. ascidian, clam) at a site;\n                    6.\tAlgae information including percent cover of algae at a site and percent contribution of algae functional groups to algae cover at a site;\n                    7.\tOpen substrate – the percent cover of the site that had no flora or habitat forming benthic invertebrates present;\n                    8.\tDominant sediment type - Sediment type based on grain size visual assessment or deck descriptions.\n                    9.\tSurvey method and vessel\n                    10.\tRelevant comments and presence/absence of megafauna and animals of interest (dugong, turtle, dolphin, evidence of dugong feeding trails);\n                    11.\tData custodians.\n\n                    Seagrass meadow layer\n                    Seagrass presence/absence site data, mapping sites, field notes, and satellite imagery were used to construct meadow boundaries in ArcGIS®. The meadow (polygon) layer provides summary information for all sites within each seagrass meadow, including:\n                    1.\tTemporal survey details – Survey month and year as individual columns and the survey date (the date range the survey took place);\n                    2.\tSpatial survey details – Survey location, meadow identification number that identifies the reef name and the meadow number. This allows individual meadows to be compared among years;\n                    3.\tSurvey method;\n                    4.\tMeadow depth for subtidal meadows. Intertidal: meadow was mapped on an exposed bank during low tide;\n                    5.\tSpecies presence – a list of the seagrass species in the meadow;\n                    6.\tMeadow density – Seagrass meadows were classified as light, moderate, dense based on the mean biomass of the dominant species within the meadow. For example, a Thalassia hemprichii dominated meadow would be classed as “light” if the mean meadow biomass was <5 grams dry weight m-2 (g DW m-2), and “dense” if mean meadow biomass was >25 g DW m-2.\n                    7.\tMeadow community type – Seagrass meadows were classified into community types according to seagrass species composition within each meadow. Species composition was based on the percent each species’ biomass contributed to mean meadow biomass. A standard nomenclature system was used to categorize each meadow.\n                    8.\tMean meadow biomass measured in g DW m-2 (+ standard error if available);\n                    9.\tMeadow area (hectares; ha) (+ mapping precision) of each meadow was calculated in the GDA 2020 Geoscience Australia MGA Zone 53 projection using the ‘calculate geometry’ function in ArcMap. Mapping precision estimates (R; in ha) were based on the mapping method used for that meadow.  Mapping precision estimate was used to calculate an error buffer around each meadow; the area of this buffer is expressed as a meadow reliability estimate (R) in hectares;\n                    10.\tAny relevant comments;\n                    11.\tData custodians.\n\n                    Seagrass biomass interpolation layer\n                    An inverse distance weighted (IDW) interpolation was applied to seagrass site data to describe spatial variation in seagrass biomass within seagrass meadows. The interpolation was conducted in ArcMap 10.8.\n                    Base map\n                    The base map used is courtesy ESRI 2023.\n\n                    Format of the data:\n                    This dataset consists of 1 point layer package, 1 polygon layer package and 1 raster file:\n                    1.\tYanyuwa Sea Country sites 2021-2022.lpk\n                    -\tSymbology representing seagrass presence/absence at each survey site\n                    2.\tYanyuwa Sea Country seagrass meadows 2021-2022.lpk\n                    -\tSymbology representing dominant species (in terms of biomass) for each intertidal meadow.\n                    3.\tYanyuwa Sea Country seagrass biomass interpolation 2021-2022.lpk\n                    -\tSymbology representing the spatial variation in seagrass biomass within each seagrass meadow.\n\n                    Data dictionary:\n                    Yanyuwa Sea Country sites 2021-2022 (point data)\n                    SITE (text) - Unique identifier representing a single sample site\n                    MEADOW (text) - Unique identifier representing what meadow the sample site is located in.

This data set shows that in Yanyuwa sea country in the Gulf of Carpentaria, that there is significant seagrass along the coastline. The inshore coastline seagrass continues from Rosie Creek to Robinson River, where King Ash Bay and Bing Bong has almost continuous, reasonably dense seagrass meadows. Seagrass cover is present around the north, east and southern intertidal areas of West Island. Around the northern side of Black Islet has seagrass as well as north areas of Skull Island. Watson Island has seagrass areas on the southern and eastern coastlines. Seagrass cover can be found on Centre Island on all sides, particularly on the east and western sides. Vanderlin Island has light seagrass cover mostly towards the southern tip. Species present in these regions include C. serrulate, E. acoroides, H. ovalis, H. uninervis.\n\n\n                    eAtlas Processing:\n                    The original data were provided as ArcGIS Layer Packages (lpk].
