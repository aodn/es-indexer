  "description" : "This dataset contains records of sting events and specimen samples of jellyfish (Irukanji, Halo irukanji, Box jellyfish and Morbakka) from the Venomous Jellyfish Database. This dataset contains an extract of 1081 sting events (in CSV format) from along the north Queensland coast between December 1883 to March 2017. The full database contains approximately 3000 sting events from around Australia and includes records from sources that have not yet been cleared for release.\n\n                    This extract from the Venomous Jellyfish Database was made for eAtlas as part of the 2.2.3 NESP Irukandji forecasting system project. It contains jellyfish sting and specimen information. Data were compiled from numerous sources (noted in each record), including Lisa-ann Gershwin and media reports. These data will be used as part of the Irukandji forecasting model. The extract data file contains data that is publicly available.\n\n                    The sting data includes primary information such as date, time of day and locality of stings, as well as secondary details such as age and gender of the sting victim, where on the body they were stung, their activity at the time of the sting and their general medical condition.\n\n\n                    Limitations:\n                    This data shows the occurrence of reported jellyfish stings and specimens along the north Queensland coast. It does NOT provide a prediction of where jellyfish or jellyfish sting events may occur.\n\n                    These records represent a fraction of known sting events and specimen collections, with more being added to the list of publicly available data as permissions are granted.\n\n                    Historical data dates may be coarse, showing month and year that the sting occurred in. Some events have date only.\n\n\n                    Methods:\n                    This data set contains information on sting events and specimen collections that have occurred around Australia, which involved venomous jellyfish (Irukandji syndrome-producing species in the genera Carukia, Malo, Morbakka).\n\n                    These data were collected over numerous years by Lisa-ann Gershwin and others from various sources (primarily media). These data were entered into an excel spreadsheet, which formed the basis of the Venomous Jellyfish Database. This database was developed as part of the 2.2.3 NESP Irukandji forecasting system project.\n\n                    Some data have been standardised, e.g., location information and sting site on the body. Data available to the public have been approved by the data owners, or came from a public source (e.g. newspaper reports, media alerts).\n\n\n                    Format:\n\n                    This dataset consists of one Comma Separated Value (CSV) table containing information on jellyfish events along the north Queensland coast. eAtlas Note: The original database extract was provided as an Excel spreadsheet table. This was converted to a CSV file.\n\n\n                    Data Dictionary:\n\n                    CSIRO_ID: unique id\n                    EVENT_TYPE: type of event – sting or specimen\n                    STATE: state in which event occurred\n                    REGION: broader region of State the event occurred in\n                    LOCAL_GOV_AREA: local government area that the event occurred in – if known\n                    MAIN_LOCALITY: main locality that the event occurred in\n                    SITE_INFO: site details/comments\n                    YEAR: year event occurred\n                    MONTH: month event occurred\n                    DAY: day of the month the event occurred\n                    DATE_RANGE: date range event may have occurred in\n                    EVENT_TIME: time the event occurred HH24:MI.
