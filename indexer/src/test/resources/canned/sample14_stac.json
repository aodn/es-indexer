    "statement": "The data has undergone the following quality control tests: \n1) Impossible date test, which checks if time values are within a timeframe possible for the ANFOG fleet; 2) Impossible location test, which requires that the observation latitude and longitude from the float be sensible; \n3) Range test, which applies a gross filter on observed values for the measured scientific parameters, that accommodates all of the expected extremes encountered in the oceans around Australia;\n4) Deepest pressure test, which requires that the profile has pressures/depths that are not higher than vehicle safe depth range plus 10%. (If there is a region of incorrect pressures, all corresponding measurements are also flagged as bad data.) \n5) Spike test, which considers that the difference between sequential measurements where one measurement is quite different than adjacent ones, is a spike in both size and gradient. The test does not consider the differences in depth, but assumes a sampling that adequately reproduces the temperature and salinity changes with depth. The algorithm is used on temperature and salinity profiles only. \n6) Gradient test, which is failed when the difference between vertically adjacent measurements is too steep. The test does not consider the differences in depth, but assumes a sampling that adequately reproduces the temperature and salinity changes with depth. The algorithm is used on temperature and salinity profiles only.\n\n \n\nThe results of the above mentioned tests are listed using an IMOS standard set of IODE flags, which the user should refer to when using the data. Only items flagged as 1: Good data or 8: Interpolated data should be used. Each parameter's quality flagging is found in its corresponding quality control parameter (e.g. for the parameter PSAL, the quality flags are found in PSAL_quality_control). \nFor further information, please refer to IMOS NETCDF USER'S MANUAL version 1.2 and AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL FACILITY FOR OCEAN GLIDERS (ANFOG) DATA MANAGEMENT USER'S MANUAL version 1.2 .",

By changing its buoyancy, the glider is able to descend and ascend. This momentum is converted to forward motion by its wings. Pitch adjustments are made by moving an internal mass (battery pack) and steering is done using a rudder and/or battery packs. Moving at an average horizontal velocity of 25 - 40 cm s-1 the glider navigates its way to a series of pre-programmed waypoints using GPS, internal dead reckoning and altimeter measurements. The gliders are programmed to provide data through satellite communication when it is at the surface and it is also possible to control the path of the glider during its mission. \\n\\nSlocum gliders, manufactured by Webb Research Corp are optimised for shallow coastal water (< 200m) where high maneuverability is needed. Slocum gliders have a maximum endurance of 30 days and are used in intensive coastal monitoring.\\n\\nSlocum gliders are commonly instrumented with a Seabird-CTD (SBE 41 or GPCTD), WETLabs ECO Triplet (measuring Chlorophyll-a, CDOM & Backscatter), a Satlantic OCR-504 multispectral radiometer and an Aanderaa Oxygen optode.\"}"
