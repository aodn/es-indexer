    "statement" : "Samples\n\n          The majority of samples were collected within coastal waters of eastern Tasmania, Australia. Care was taken to ensure that collection did not stress the zooplankton (distorting their structure/appearance). Samples were processed and images taken as soon as possible, to capture the natural appearance and colouration of the zooplankton. As zooplankton are often preserved prior to sorting and identification, we have also photographed and represented preserved specimens of some taxa for comparison. Where a preserved animal is photographed, this is stated in the caption. Additionally, as the preference for zooplankton sorting under a microscope varies, in some cases specimens are represented both on light and dark backgrounds.",
