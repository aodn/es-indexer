  "description" : "The Australian National Facility for Ocean Gliders (ANFOG) manages five Sea gliders to monitor the boundary currents surroundings Australia.\n\n                    Seagliders are autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) which harvest their propulsion from the ocean itself. By changing its buoyancy via an inflatable oil-filled bladder, the Seaglider is able to descend and ascend. This momentum is converted to forward motion by its wings. Pitch adjustments are made by moving an internal mass (battery pack) forward or backward, and steering is done by rolling the battery packs. Moving at an average horizontal velocity of 25 - 40 cm s-1, the glider navigates its way to a series of waypoints using GPS, internal dead reckoning and altimeter measurements. Because the gliders are programmed to provide data and vehicle technical parameters through satellite communication when it is at the surface and glider pilots at the ANFOG control centre (at the University of Western Australia) can continuously trim the Seaglider for optimal flight, change the voyage route, and examine the scientific data during the mission.\n\n                    Sea gliders, built at the University of Washington, are designed to operate most efficiently in the open ocean up to 1000m water depth. Sea gliders have a maximum endurance time of up to 6 months and are used to gather long term environmental records.\n\n                    Sea gliders are equipped with a Seabird CTD (SBE 41), WETLabs ECO Triplet (measuring chlorophyll-a, CDOM and 660nm Backscatter) and a Seabird oxygen sensor (SBE 43).",
